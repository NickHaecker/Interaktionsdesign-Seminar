	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} Four approaches to playing {MUDs} are identified and described. These approaches may arise from the inter-relationship of two dimensions of playing style: action versus interaction, and world-oriented versus player-oriented. An account of the dynamics of player populations is given in terms of these dimensions, with particular attention to how to promote balance or equilibrium. This analysis also offers an explanation for the labelling of {MUDs} as being either "social" or "gamelike".},
