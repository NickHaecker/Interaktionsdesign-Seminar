	abstract = {This introductory article provides basic definitions, concepts and theories surrounding gamification that are used throughout the remainder of this book. It distinguishes gamification from other research areas, such as gameful design and serious games. It then goes on to introduce common game mechanics, achievement systems, game dynamics and aesthetics. The second part of the article focusses on underlying theories. It examines the influence of motivation theory, achievement goal theory and flow theory on gamification. The article also describes different player archetypes.},
