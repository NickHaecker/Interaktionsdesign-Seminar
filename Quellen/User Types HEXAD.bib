	abstract = {Based on research about human motivation and player types and practical design experiences, we present a gamification user type model, which is a first typology to classify users of gamified systems. This model helps in the segmentation/clustering of users based on intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors. We identify six gamification user types: Socializers, Free Spirits, Achievers, Philanthropists, Players and Disruptors. Together with the model, we suggest gamification mechanics that offer suitable motivational affordances for each user type. The model should assist researchers and practitioners in tailored and personalized gamified system design, to make gamified systems more appealing and successful. In the future, we will empirically validate and advance the model.},
