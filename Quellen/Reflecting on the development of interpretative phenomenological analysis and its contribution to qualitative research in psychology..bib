	abstract = {This paper reflects on the development of interpretative phenomenological analysis ({IPA}) as one particular qualitative approach to psychology. After a brief introduction to {IPA}, the paper outlines what can be described as its characteristic features: idiographic, inductive, interrogative, illustrating each feature with examples from studies which have been conducted with {IPA}. The paper then considers the different levels of interpretation, which are possible with {IPA} and discusses the notion of when an interpretation is 'good enough'. It goes on to consider issues around the types of topics for which {IPA} is suitable and the emerging pattern of work using the approach. The next section considers how {IPA} studies can widen the type of participants included and also examines the suitability of different data collection methods. The paper finishes by bringing together some thoughts on the future development of {IPA}. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2019 {APA}, all rights reserved)},
