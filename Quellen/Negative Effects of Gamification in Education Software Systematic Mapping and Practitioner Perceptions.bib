	abstract = {Context: While most research shows positive effects of gamification, the focus on its adverse effects is considerably smaller and further understanding is needed. Objective: To provide a comprehensive overview on research reporting negative effects of game design elements and to provide insights into the awareness of developers on these effects and into how they could be considered in practice. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study of the negative effects of game design elements on education/learning systems. We also held a focus group discussion with developers of a gamified software, discussing the mapping study results with regard to their awareness and perceptions on the reported negative effects in practice. Results: The mapping study revealed 87 papers reporting undesired effects of game design elements. We found that badges, leaderboards, competitions, and points are the game design elements most often reported as causing negative effects. The most cited negative effects were lack of effect, worsened performance, motivational issues, lack of understanding, and irrelevance. The ethical issues of gaming the system and cheating were also often reported. As part of our results, we map the relations between game design elements and the negative effects that they may cause. The focus group revealed that developers were not aware of many of the possible negative effects and that they consider this type of information useful. The discussion revealed their agreement on some of those potential negative effects and also some positive counterparts. Conclusions: Gamification, when properly applied, can have positive effects on education/learning software. However, gamified software is also prone to generate harmful effects. Revealing and discussing potentially negative effects can help to make more informed decisions considering their trade-off with respect to the expected benefits.},
